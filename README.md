## My process

1. I started with the markup on index.html, complying with HTML5 semantic tags and standards as much as possible.
2. The styling provided by the project briefing was implemented first, followed by the classes I came up with on the markup.
3. Browser developer tools were used until I could get the dimensions just right, since all I had was an image file to base myself on.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- One of several optimal ways of centering an element on the screen while ensuring responsiveness.
